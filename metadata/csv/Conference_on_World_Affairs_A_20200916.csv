The panel discusses the 2000 American presidential election, and related issues like campaign finance reform and journalism. Mark Hertsgaard begins by arguing that the public discourse in American politics has degenerated over several decades. He links this degeneration to the culture in journalism that has devalued and effectively censored important stories. Molly Ivins continues the discussion by relating her experience covering the 2000 presidential election, including her thoughts on political reform. Dan Odescalchi shares Ivins' optimism that reform is probable, but expresses skepticism about campaign finance reform specifically. Richard Aregood laments the decline of responsible news reporting, especially in the realm of politics.",Program,1:15 Mark Hertsgaard begins* 14:39 Hertsgaard ends* 14:55 Molly Ivins begins* 25:54 Ivins ends* 26:13 Dan Odescalchi begins* 35:30 Odescalchi ends* 35:38 Richard Aregood begins* 45:56 Aregood ends* 46:10 Audience questions begin* 1:27:00 Audience questions end.,SegmentSequence,,,4/9/2001,University Memorial Center Ballroom,"Aregood, Richard",Panelist,,,,,"Ivins, Molly",Panelist,"Hertsgaard, Mark, 1956-",Panelist,"Odescalchi, Dan",Panelist,,,,,,,,,,,"CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder",Publisher,This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

With a disabled mother and living in poverty, he resorted to burglary and car theft. Marrying in 1940, he divorced a year later and was convicted in 1941 of robbery and assault. In jail he spent his time teaching subjects and debating, only to be caught in 1947 as the red-light bandit, so he was then trialed for 18 charges. This case became a legal-limbo for Chessman who had 8 executions spared out of 9.

Cuba desired to change its political system (capitalist state) and increase its international communication with nations by investing their money abroad in US or Europe. However, the Americans urged a breakaway of dependence, allowing Cuba to achieve a higher standard of living and economic dependence. However, in attempt to achieve this goal, Americans did not realize that the communists wanted to use the Cuban revolution for its own purposes with soviet aid, dependence, and anger towards the US.

Charles Butcher posits a strong intuitive feeling that there is something to the meaning of taste, even though there is danger in defining any specific thing as being in good taste. The ability to distinguish ""good"" from ""bad"" taste comes from effort -- what works for you. Norman Rudich states that taste is on of the most individual, untranslatable, and mercurial concepts to talk about. Humanizing one's surrounding leads to good taste. Clutter equals bad taste.

This allows us to discover relationships between ideas rather than having to depend on those ideas by themselves. Because of this, we must be here for some reason: to be problem-solvers for the universe. This has been Fuller's drive for the past several decades. Fuller believes that humanity is in a time of extraordinary crisis. He provides a brief history illustrating the links between power and shipping, from ancient times through Magellan to the founding of the East India Company. He then describes the links from this to Malthus and Darwin, then to Karl Marx, and the roots of the two great theories of capitalism and socialism that now have the capacity to destroy all life on this planet within minutes. Next Fuller describes the variety of forces that affect our lives, most of which we are completely unable to sense directly. From there, Fuller lists the development of materials that humanity has invented to deal with those forces and put them to use for us. He continues by describing the differences between tension and compression. Fuller brings out his tensegrity sphere to illustrate these differences, and spends some time describing how the tensegrity sphere works, and how it relates to his geodesic dome designs. Fuller then relates that in 1970, he realized that the Earth has enough resources to provide an excellent standard of living for all human beings, what that means for politics, wars, etc., and the great challenge of trying to communicate this to everyone. Next, Fuller points out a wide range of logical fallacies that are made by the general public, with a bit of nerdy humor thrown in as well as a detailed exploration of geometry. He then makes some lengthy remarks relating to humanity's place in the universe, given recent advances in standards of living as well as the development of technologies capable of destroying all life on Earth.

Takeuchi. Crime around schools has increased due to the presence of gangs and readily-available drugs. Also, changes in family demographics and the accessibility of firearms have resulted in less discipline and moral guidance. Social changes among the poor result in a loss of community, which further inhibits economic and educational opportunity for young adults. Flaws in the justice system also inhibit the rehabilitation of juveniles. Therefore, we should empower social institutions to instill positive values and reduce delinquent behavior.

This is the first of five panels in the World Affairs Conference of Disarmament. Harvey Averch argues that ""Western values"" have created a ""philosophy of force,"" creating ""symmetry"" through nuclear stalemate. He proposes alternative strategies hinging on arms control and diplomacy while still maintaining some nuclear weapons as ""deterrents."" Feigen asserts that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should not have the power to use weapons that will spread radiation across the globe and that a greater number of nuclear weapons increase the chances of ""accidental war."" He also argues for diplomacy and a world government like the UN. Averch returns to talk about systems analysis, emphasizing the importance of inspection in maintaining arms control.",Program,00:00:03 Cecil Effinger begins 00:05:01 Effinger ends 00:05:10 Harvey Averch begins 00:34:28 Averch ends 00:34:50 Gerald M.

Also, recently there has been a decline in the role of parties in bringing together factions and compromising in issues such as national security, policies, and the economy. Thus, there has been a rise in individual groups pressuring political agendas through manipulating propaganda, resulting in the decline of power for political parties. This brings with it the concern of editorial power and news filtration. Looking at this issue, suggestions for improvement range from creating a sub-government to having a quota system.",Program,@00:07 Chairman introduces speaker and topic @1:28 Cater speaks @37:47 Feigan speaks @42:39 Simon speaks @44:46 discussions open to audience @59:13 tape ends,SegmentSequence,,,4/8/1963,Guggenheim Geography 201,"Cater, Douglass, 1923-1995",Panelist,,,,,"Feigan, Gerald",Panelist,"Simon, Walter",Panelist,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder",Publisher,This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.
