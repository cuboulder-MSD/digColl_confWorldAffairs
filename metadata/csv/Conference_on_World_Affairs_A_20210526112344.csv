Economic well being and adjusted happiness must be equal among strong and weak nations, which in turn increases communication for the myth of self.

He also introduces the members of the panel; 07:00 Bill Weeden begins his discussion. He talks about how he is a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and how he has not had a drink for the last nine years. He also talks about how he used to drink every time he had a problem or to enhance his emotions; 08:30 Weeden talks about alcohol as a societal tool and how some people can mess up their life addicted to alcohol; 09:48 Weeden talks about living in reality after being sober for nine years. He used to drink to shut out reality. He also talks about functioning alcoholics; 11:23 Sue Korenbaum begins her discussion. She starts her talk about drinking and driving; 13:00 Korenbaum talks about a study done that showed most drunk drivers were men. She also mentions it did not matter what the legal drinking age was and concludes that the norms or social factors in our society are presented to younger people in a bad way, meaning â€œin order to have a good time, we have to drinkâ€; 16:05 Roger Ebert begins his discussion; 16:45 Ebert admits he has experienced the pain of those who drank and drove. He also admits he did it himself; 18:00 Ebert talks about the normal amount of drinks an average person should have; 18:55 Ebert talks about previous panels like this one and jokes about the topic being â€œdryâ€ this year.

He talks about how he is going to attend a real AA meeting that night and tells the audience they are welcome to join if they have a desire to stop drinking; 21:34 Ebert talks about the large amount of material written about alcoholism recently. He talks about the theories about alcohol such as the genetic transmission or genetic predisposition to alcoholism; 22:30 Ebert mentions the book â€œThe Natural History of Alcoholismâ€ by George Vaillant. The book contains a survey of people before they started drinking and how certain â€œpersonality defectsâ€ influence some people to drink alcohol; 27:59 Ebert talks about preventive measures to educate young people about alcoholism. He mentions the compulsion to abuse drugs and alcohol is so strong there is probably nothing we can really do until the abuser chooses to change their lifestyle. He also talks about alcoholism considered as a disease and help from hospitals; 29:40 Ebert mentions that according to AA one must â€œhit rock-bottomâ€ before realizing they need help; 33:16 Shepherd Brooks begins his discussion. He tells a story about driving on the interstate and eating at a truck-stop with other people around.

He continues to talk about the number of children that also drink in Australia; 36:53 Brooks states that there is conflicting information about the country that drinks the most alcohol. One study mentioned the Soviet Union was the country that consumed the most alcohol, but Brooks states that a different study mentioned that France was the country with the highest alcohol consumption. He also says Israel is the country with the lowest amount of alcohol consumption. He continues to say that societal influence in Israel is seen through the low numbers of alcohol consumption; 38:27 Brooks talks about the laws being enacted in several states so that the legal drinking age is changed to 21 years; 39:40 Brooks quotes from an article by Jane Brody in the New York Times.

While he approves of the education in the country the message often goes to people already drinking or smoking and it is not really used as a preventive measure; 01:06:13 Unidentified person talks about the social consequences of drinking. She also talks about teenagers and drinking; 01:08:57 Audience member asks Weeden and Ebert for advice on helping a friend give up alcohol before they hit rock bottom; 01:15:13 Audience member states that it would be helpful for alcoholics to make the twelve-step program and other programs readily available.

He talks about the AA meetings in Beverly Hills and how the money, leisure time and egos or insecurity of people has led to cocaine abuse; 01:20:24 Audience member asks about the organizations that advertise on television. Panel mentions that it is probably dangerous to introduce someone to AA if they are not ready for it; 01:24:08 Audience member states that it seems the alcoholics he knows personally, as well as novelists, tend to be sensitive people and asks the panel if alcohol is a product to understanding the worldâ€™s pain; 01:30:44 Audience member asks the panel if it could be counterproductive for some people if alcoholism is labeled as a disease; 01:34:35 Audience member asks about raising kids and the perception of drinking that parents can instill on their children. Panelist does not believe in rigidity and does not trust people who do not drink at all; 01:43:16 Audience member talks about physical fitness and steering young people away from alcohol.

It is reasoned that it involves one's political allegiance, leading from university to often work in government. The role of an intellectual is described through society's expectations, and one's work, performance, and interests. One speaker claims that the word 'intellectual' is more of an adjective than a noun in the US because it is almost a profession here, a way to self-recognize.

He talks about dividing the world into two parts and what man tends to think about as bad taste using the technique of reduction to absurdity. Gilbert Seldes makes the point that all methods by which taste is changed are themselves changed and this rate of change is accelerating. Charles Butcher posits a strong intuitive feeling that there is something to the meaning of taste, even though there is danger in defining any specific thing as being in good taste. The ability to distinguish ""good"" from ""bad"" taste comes from effort -- what works for you. Norman Rudich states that taste is on of the most individual, untranslatable, and mercurial concepts to talk about. Humanizing one's surrounding leads to good taste. Clutter equals bad taste. The question session is poignant and funny. Chairman Paul V. Thompson presiding.","Program","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Old Main Chapel","Fuller, R.

She talks about studentsâ€™ experiences with Martin Luther King Jr. and former riots they had been in; 07:10 Havice explains why riots occur and mentions that riots are not the only form of violence by a group of people.

The reasons for refusal could be due to religious training or beliefs, which are strong enough to place a sense of responsibility upon the person to not enter the armed forces.

Corporations, she claims, are valued for the goods and services they supply; however, in terms of economics, political power, and environmental effects it is our responsibility to monitor corporations. Lastly, she emphasizes that environmental acts are standards for the country and that corporations must meet and preserve these standards.","Program","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","University Memorial Center Ballroom","Underwood, Joanna D.","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Dodson says everyone needs to discover their own bodies; 13:54 Dodson talks about pair bonding and solo relationships; 15:00 Dodson talks about discovering your own sexual response patterns and the attitude of masturbation between men and women; 16:30 Dodson talks about the married women she works with at her workshops and the lack of information women have about their bodies. She continues to say that there should be no restrictions as to how people socialize their sexuality; 18:09 Hamlin asks Dodson about how hard it must have been to look directly at genitalia and how she decided to teach others about that. Dodson states she always thought her genitalia was deformed; 20:50 Hamlin asks how easy it is for women to learn quickly about themselves at the workshop and the impact the information has on women; 22:09 Hamlin states that her movement has caused a lot of men to put themselves down and Dodson tells a story about men coming to her workshop as well. The men also find out they are not as sexually aware; 23:00 Hamlin and Dodson talk about using vibrators. Dodson also talks about a â€œmeditation on self-loveâ€ and designing your own sex trip; 25:20 Hamlin thinks Dodson is narrowing what could be considered a pleasure. Dodson talks about food, painting, people, and other things that could be considered pleasurable; 27:18 Audience member asks Dodson if most women are following male sexual response patterns. Dodson talks about sex roles and rhythm; 28:40 Audience member asks about the training Dodson has done and the quick orgasm. She talks about delaying your orgasm; 31:44 Audience member asks Hamlin and Dodson about how quickly women can orgasm alone but achieving an orgasm with a man takes longer because women are too afraid to speak up. Hamlin canâ€™t believe Dodson is not teaching more men since it sounds like they also need the education; 33:04 Audience member states that one must deal with themselves first before partnering with someone else. Hamlin disagrees and talks about the fall-out of a relationship once they become liberated and masturbation is too soloist. A man in the audience disagrees with Hamlin and mentions men actually do not feel that threatened about women learning more about their bodies; 35:53 Audience member asks what is wrong when one partner becomes liberated while in a pair bond when they were not liberated before; 36:36 Audience member comments about the hostility regarding liberation and master-slave relationships during sex; 38:35 Dodson refers to herself and states she is â€œwalking around with the best lover I knowâ€ and how secure she feels about herself; 39:17 Audience member asks about monogamy; 38:29 Audience member asks about complex sexual responses between men and women. Dodson talks about finding a compatible energy; 41:11 Audience member talks about stereotypes between men and women regarding sex; 42:09 Audience member asks how Dodson critiques Freudâ€™s analysis of masturbation being infantile; 44:18 Audience member asks Dodson whether or not â€œpeople that get stuck on the masturbating level are going to be homosexual and lesbian.â€ Dodson states they can if they want to, people should choose and that masturbation leads to sexual preference; 45:39 Audience member asks about Dodsonâ€™s remark of how becoming more sexually open made more people open to her; 47:13 Hamlin asks Dodson how she foresees the future of family structure and monogamy and children; 49:13 [Sheets] talks about rapid change and then the panel goes outside; 49:42 Recording cuts out and repeats the point Hamlin asked about regarding the family structure.","Program","","","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Guggenheim 201","Dodson, Betty","Panelist","","","","","Hamlin, Sonya","Panelist","[James, Jennifer]","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Thomas Adams agrees with Cornet in that there is no actual causation between media and addiction, and explores why people first start using drugs and subsequent media targeting of race and gender groups. Bruce Sumner ponders the significance of the first amendment and the societal origins of addiction, agreeing with his panelists that the media is merely a reflection of society, and does not instigate addiction.","Program","00:00:02 Fagan begins -- 00:01:35 Fagan ends -- 00:01:37 Robert Cornet begins -- 00:08:02 Cornet ends -- 00:08:05 Thomas Adams begins -- 00:30:25 Adams ends -- 00:30:37 Bruce Sumner begins -- 00:37:26 Sumner ends -- 00:37:27 Questions from the audience begin -- 01:13:23 Questions from the audience end -- 01:13:30 End of tape.","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","University Memorial Center 157","Adams, W.

He ponders why there are some who resist learning, and questions the historical background of learning. Molly Ivins argues there are three sources of the hatred of learning: sense of failure, the perception that people use knowledge as an oppressive weapon, and the idea that learning results in abandonment of former identity. Michael Stoff claims learning is an ongoing process and concurs with Edmondsonâ€™s belief that it is human nature to learn. He explores American societyâ€™s treatment of teachers and the possible reasons for failing teachers.","Program","00:00:00 Leo W.

He states that if an average undergraduate student can design a workable atomic device then it is safe to assume that a terrorist group can too. He also mentions that it is important that these organizations do not get their hands on the uranium or plutonium; 50:50 Discussion ends.","Program","","","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Macky Auditorium","Phillips, John A.","Panelist","","","","","Hamlin, Sonya","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Coker; 00:11 Coker introduces the panel; 2:04 Sonya Hamlin begins the discussion by asking the audience if they have read Whitley Strieberâ€™s book titled â€œCommunion: A True Storyâ€; 02:49 Strieber talks about his experience and how the book is a true story; 04:00 Strieber talks about the skepticism of his experience and asks the audience to have an open mind; 05:15 Strieber starts with his first experience by stating he went to a therapist after the event happened because he thought he was totally mad. He starts talking about the night of December 26th, 1985 when he was awakened by a loud rustling noise in his cabin in a remote area. He mentions he saw a figure about three and half feet tall standing in the doorway and other smaller figures running through the doorway; 09:15 Strieber talks about how he was being carried away by the figures that came into the bedroom and into the woods and the snow. He mentions him and his doctor used hypnosis to try to remember details he could not normally remember. 11:25 Strieber talks about the next figure he saw in the woods with a tan suit on. He then talks about how he was rising above the forest and into a room. He then sees a figure that looks like the one depicted on the cover of his book â€œCommunion: A True Story.â€; 12:35 Strieber describes the round room he was now in with the visitor. He talks about how he was trying to wake up and felt as if his mind and body were separate from each other. Once he realizes he is already awake he began to panic; 14:51 Strieber talks about the first words he heard from the figure. In a deep voice the figure stated â€œweâ€™re going to do an operation on your brain.â€ He says he began to scream and an electronic, mechanical female voice asked him â€œwhat can we do to help you stop screaming?â€ He responds by saying â€œYou could let me smell you!â€ because he could not see or use his other senses. A figure held up a hand and it had a mild, dry, cheesy smell or cardboard smell. He also states the figures were gray in color; 20:48 Strieber talks about the procedures the visitors started doing to him. He talks about the operation he had on his brain. He also mentions a rectal probe. 22:35 Strieber talks about how he got out of the round room and made it home. He talks about how he remembers sitting in his living room on his couch, naked, and with a terrible taste in his mouth. When he woke up the next morning, he had a terrible feeling the entire day. He also mentions he had not talked to his wife about it at first. 26:00 Strieber talks about his family ski trip and how he started to feel a sharp pain behind his ear. He continues to say that his wife mentioned it looked like he had a small needle mark on his head. 26:55 Hamlin asks Strieber why he went to the psychiatrist. Strieber explains that he had a few long interviews with the psychiatrist and suggested that hypnosis might help to retrieved some of the missing parts of his memory.

Cuba desired to change its political system (capitalist state) and increase its international communication with nations by investing their money abroad in US or Europe. However, the Americans urged a breakaway of dependence, allowing Cuba to achieve a higher standard of living and economic dependence. However, in attempt to achieve this goal, Americans did not realize that the communists wanted to use the Cuban revolution for its own purposes with soviet aid, dependence, and anger towards the US. Finally, a speaker states the necessity of a new policy that will not result in war but instead provide a chance to prove sincerity between US and Cuban relations.","Program","@00:07 host introduces topic and panel @3:09 Godoy begins @25:56 Godoy ends / Worthy speaks @42:24 Worthy ends / Stone begins @56:11 Stone ends / Ornes begins @01:05:20 Tape ends","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","University Theatre","Godoy, Horacio","Panelist","","","","","Worthy, William","Panelist","Ornes, German","Panelist","Stone, I.F.","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He specifies that lawless authority has especially affected American Indians and American blacks. Coercion arises not only from local police or judicial authorities, but is also a principal tool of the Pentagon in the prosecution of illegal war.

McMahon. Richard Fryklund starts by exploring the possibility of creating a NATO counterforce that would focus on targeting Soviet nuclear weapons in order to avoid a nuclear war targeting cities. Stanley Reed covers the reasons why NATO was founded. Fryklund discusses the why a NATO counterforce would be infeasible. Harvey Averch states that nuclear weapons should only be used ""in direct retaliation"" or in ""the defense of the free world"" and that a NATO counterforce is a better alternative to nuclear warfare. Noel Parrish mentions how previous and current attempts to build up a conventional force in Europe have failed, reasons why a large conventional force will never be amassed by Europe, and how nuclear warfare as the only option. A discussion between the speakers follows.","Program","00:00:04 John F.

The panel discusses the 2000 American presidential election, and related issues like campaign finance reform and journalism. Mark Hertsgaard begins by arguing that the public discourse in American politics has degenerated over several decades. He links this degeneration to the culture in journalism that has devalued and effectively censored important stories. Molly Ivins continues the discussion by relating her experience covering the 2000 presidential election, including her thoughts on political reform. Dan Odescalchi shares Ivins' optimism that reform is probable, but expresses skepticism about campaign finance reform specifically. Richard Aregood laments the decline of responsible news reporting, especially in the realm of politics.","Program","1:15 Mark Hertsgaard begins* 14:39 Hertsgaard ends* 14:55 Molly Ivins begins* 25:54 Ivins ends* 26:13 Dan Odescalchi begins* 35:30 Odescalchi ends* 35:38 Richard Aregood begins* 45:56 Aregood ends* 46:10 Audience questions begin* 1:27:00 Audience questions end.","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","University Memorial Center Ballroom","Aregood, Richard","Panelist","","","","","Ivins, Molly","Panelist","Hertsgaard, Mark, 1956-","Panelist","Odescalchi, Dan","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Takeuchi. Crime around schools has increased due to the presence of gangs and readily-available drugs. Also, changes in family demographics and the accessibility of firearms have resulted in less discipline and moral guidance. Social changes among the poor result in a loss of community, which further inhibits economic and educational opportunity for young adults. Flaws in the justice system also inhibit the rehabilitation of juveniles. Therefore, we should empower social institutions to instill positive values and reduce delinquent behavior. The speaker asks: Are juveniles to blame for increases in violence, or does the failure lie within society itself?

The panel approaches the question posed by the title of the panel. Sean Kelly is uncomfortable with the title, and suggests that American voting systems may be more stupid than people. Dan Odescalchi argues that people in America have a stake in their government and tend to vote rationally. Simon Hoggart facetiously proposes an elitist scenario resulting in corporations voting in American elections. Joan Higman Davies makes an argument for proportional representation, and Molly Ivins makes a populist argument. During the audience question period, the panelists discuss voting patterns, the electoral college, education, and election strategy.","Program","00:01:12 Panelists introduced -- 00:04:07 Sean Kelly begins -- 00:07:57 Kelly ends -- 00:08:05 Odescalchi begins -- 00:13:52 Odescalchi ends -- 00:14:10 Simon Hoggart begins -- 00:24:55 Hoggart ends -- 00:25:08 Joan Higman Davies begins -- 00:29:51 Davies ends -- 00:30:00 Molly Ivins begins -- 00:37:55 Ivins ends -- 00:38:50 Audience questions begin -- 01:27:25 Audience questions end.","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","University Memorial Center Ballroom","Davies, Joan Higman","Speaker","","","","","Hoggart, Simon, 1946-2014","Speaker","Odescalchi, Dan","Speaker","Ivins, Molly","Speaker","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He states he supports President Reaganâ€™s Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars Program; Cohen believes that Reaganâ€™s claim that the defensive system is â€œleakproofâ€ is absurd. He continues to talk about the testing and how the military planners did not take the real world into account; 06:20 Cohen states the only way we will know how effective the Strategic Defense Initiative system is will be when we have a nuclear war; 06:43 Cohen comments on another claim from Reagan that the defense system is supposed to protect American cities. Cohen also believes that claim to be absurd and unrealistic. He states the claims were a political ploy to win over scientists against the nuclear system; 11:30 Cohen talks about the sole focus from the president was on the Sovietâ€™s threat from their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs); 15:58 Cohen talks about the best actions we can take right now which is taking on a mainly defensive posture by establishing air and civil defenses; 18:03 John Gliedmean begins his discussion. He states he wants to address the question as to why in the 1980s has a contradictory, nonsensical missile defense system been pushed so hard by the current administration and accepted by the scientific community; 19:24 Gliedmean presents the contradictions of the Star Wars Program. He states the program is a political response about policy making of armaments. He also talks about the basic economy of the United States; 41:37 John Tirman begins his discussion. He states that the moral intent of the Star Wars Program was to implement a defense system rather than retaliate after we have been attacked, but he believes Star Wars will not deliver on its promises to defend American citizens; 42:50 Tirman talks about the technological problems of the program first; 44:16 Tirman talks about the claims made by the Reagan administration that putting up a defense system does not hurt anyone; however, Tirman states that is untrue because the Soviet Union does not perceive the defense program in a passive way. Also, the Soviet Union perceives Star Wars as a first strike capability in national defense; 56:07 First audience member asks Cohen if Star Wars hardware can be made invulnerable to electromagnetic pulses; 57:40 Next audience member asks if the next administration will pick up the Strategic Defense Initiative after the Reagan administration; 01:01:06 Audience member comments that he is dismayed about Cohenâ€™s negative opinions of nuclear war; 01:03:00 Audience member asks about the Russians [catalogerâ€™s note: question difficult to decipher]; 01:14:55 Audience member asks if the panel can comment on Star Wars II as an alternative; 01:18:19 Audience member asks a questions about Russian actions; 01:25:44 Audience member asks about the capability to do missile defense and the technology involved with the system; 01:28:11 Same audience member asks a second question about radiation and a potential nuclear winter; 01:36:10 Audience member asks what loss our nation is willing to sustain from nuclear war; 01:36:53 Audience member asks what a public strategy could be and its limitations; 01:45:12 Audience member asks if the existence of chemical warfare would make Strategic Defense Initiative irrelevant; 01:46:10 Audience member asks Cohen about counteracting attacks from the Soviet Union; 01:48:38 Recording cuts out.","Program","","","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Old Main Chapel","Cohen, Samuel","Panelist","","","","","Gliedmean, John","Panelist","Tirman, John","Panelist","[Lawrence, Richard]","Panelist","[Goulard, Robert]","Panelist","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

He talks about the administrationâ€™s program for ballistic missile defense, also known as the Star Wars Program; 03:00 Dean talks about the doubts of ballistic missile defense. He talks about Western defenses from Soviet attack; 04:15 There are three major doubts amongst experts about the Strategic Defense Initiative for ballistic missile defense. First, the feasibility of rapid defense is doubted. Second, skeptics doubt Soviet counter measures. Third, skeptics are concerned over the heightened possibility that in a situation of competition the Soviet Union might considered a preemptive attack; 07:41 Dean talks about the immediate consequences of the missile defense program. He first talks about the United Statesâ€™ NATO allies; 11:24 Dean talks about the European viewpoint if the missile defense program were successful; 13:14 Dean talks about another area of concern being American missile defense would not prove effective and there would be a dangerous increase in Soviet-U.S. tensions; 13:55 Another concern of European governments was the impact of public opinion of a major new controversy over defense; 17:10 Dean states the positive element of the American program includes European participation and research; 22:29 Dean mentions the major problem for the American ballistic missile defense program will be a political one; 25:10 Dean talks about the deploying of American pershing missiles; 29:29 Dean talks about the Soviet Unionâ€™s participation in Geneva talks and the actions they have done with their missiles. He states the missile defense program has decreased any potential willingness for Russians to reduce their missiles; 38:47 Dean asks, â€œwhat can be done here to break this deadlock?â€ between the Russians and U.S. He continues to say that the U.S. should not place too much reliance too early on an untried missile defense technology; therefore, risking the protection the U.S. currently has; 41:40 Dean concludes that the U.S. should aim for an agreement that prohibits the testing or deployment of weapons in space and the testing of defense against tactical nuclear missiles. He continues to list other stipulations about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM); 47:40 First audience member asks Dean why take such a negative view towards the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI or also known as the Star Wars Program); 50:02 Volsky thanks Dean and panel ends.","Program","","","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Macky Auditorium","Dean, Jonathan","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

With a disabled mother and living in poverty, he resorted to burglary and car theft. Marrying in 1940, he divorced a year later and was convicted in 1941 of robbery and assault. In jail he spent his time teaching subjects and debating, only to be caught in 1947 as the red-light bandit, so he was then trialed for 18 charges. This case became a legal-limbo for Chessman who had 8 executions spared out of 9. Thus in this panel capital punishment and abolishment are discussed, including statistics on the pros and cons of the death penalty. Speakers discuss the importance of the deterrent effect, rather than executions.","Program","@1:25 Chairman introduces speakers @2:55 Truitt speaks @33:26 Butler begins @42:04 Thomas speaks @57:35 tape ends","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Hellems Arts and Sciences 213","Truitt, James","Panelist","","","","","Butler, Pierce lll","Panelist","Thomas, Norman","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Also, recently there has been a decline in the role of parties in bringing together factions and compromising in issues such as national security, policies, and the economy. Thus, there has been a rise in individual groups pressuring political agendas through manipulating propaganda, resulting in the decline of power for political parties. This brings with it the concern of editorial power and news filtration. Looking at this issue, suggestions for improvement range from creating a sub-government to having a quota system.","Program","@00:07 Chairman introduces speaker and topic @1:28 Cater speaks @37:47 Feigan speaks @42:39 Simon speaks @44:46 discussions open to audience @59:13 tape ends","SegmentSequence","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Guggenheim Geography 201","Cater, Douglass, 1923-1995","Panelist","","","","","Feigan, Gerald","Panelist","Simon, Walter","Panelist","","","","","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

This allows us to discover relationships between ideas rather than having to depend on those ideas by themselves. Because of this, we must be here for some reason: to be problem-solvers for the universe. This has been Fuller's drive for the past several decades. Fuller believes that humanity is in a time of extraordinary crisis. He provides a brief history illustrating the links between power and shipping, from ancient times through Magellan to the founding of the East India Company. He then describes the links from this to Malthus and Darwin, then to Karl Marx, and the roots of the two great theories of capitalism and socialism that now have the capacity to destroy all life on this planet within minutes. Next Fuller describes the variety of forces that affect our lives, most of which we are completely unable to sense directly. From there, Fuller lists the development of materials that humanity has invented to deal with those forces and put them to use for us. He continues by describing the differences between tension and compression. Fuller brings out his tensegrity sphere to illustrate these differences, and spends some time describing how the tensegrity sphere works, and how it relates to his geodesic dome designs. Fuller then relates that in 1970, he realized that the Earth has enough resources to provide an excellent standard of living for all human beings, what that means for politics, wars, etc., and the great challenge of trying to communicate this to everyone. Next, Fuller points out a wide range of logical fallacies that are made by the general public, with a bit of nerdy humor thrown in as well as a detailed exploration of geometry. He then makes some lengthy remarks relating to humanity's place in the universe, given recent advances in standards of living as well as the development of technologies capable of destroying all life on Earth.

He states that faulty views of China emphasize a Maoist variant of Marxism, interested only in its own security. He suggests that China seeks links between her traditions and her new revolutionary ideologies; thus other nations should clarify their policies toward China. Her policies seem to be based on solidarity with the developing world, growth of external trade, securing governmental controls, the drive to industrialize, and the rubrics of Marxism and Leninism.

Jonathan Kwitny argues that the concentrated ownership of the media has resulted in a restricted flow of information; he provides several personal anecdotes of media corruption.

The panel discusses the various forms of X-rated films, including ""stag films"", ""adult"" films, and ""skin flicks"", which are rated X by the MPAA. The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959) was the first skin-flick in the American repertoire. The discussion attempts to describe the function of these films, their purpose, and the dangers they might present to American society. Speakers believe that these films tend to lack good filmmaking. These experiences matter especially to young adults, whose profound curiosity for the naked body renders the films irresistible. However, the speakers all agree that the X-rated film will eventually self-destruct because after viewing it, two human beings still have to communicate with each other, with or without sex.","Program","Panel discussions","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2015026010","","Old Main Chapel","Fairlie, Henry, 1924-1990","Panelist","","","","","Berg, Norman W.","Panelist","Rosenburg, Samuel","Panelist","McDonough, Walter","Panelist","Ebert, Roger","Panelist","","","","","","","","","CWA/Archives, University of Colorado at Boulder","Publisher","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Electronic music results from the ""generating of sound material"", as well as the control of sound, its storage and recording. He explains the creation of composition through parameters of pitch, amplitude and timbre. Using a synthesizer, Moog demonstrates variations in sound as pure pitch vs. pure noise (e.g., white noise), as transient variations, and through filtering to modify tone color. In composition, he emphasizes the importance of the distribution of sounds as an expression for electronic expression.
